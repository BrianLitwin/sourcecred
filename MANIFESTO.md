# SourceCred Manifesto

The open-source movement is inspiring. It's amazing that some of our best
technology is developed in the open, and made freely available to everyone.

Despite this, open-source sees chronically underinvestment, because we lack
systems that reward people who contribute to the open-source commons. We
believe people can and should be paid for their open-source labors of love, and
want to make open-source truly sustainable by compensating open-source
maintainers and contributors.

We believe that recent developments, especially the advent of cryptonetworks,
create such an opportunity. We imagine a world where any open-source project
can issue project-specific cryptotokens, called "grain", which act as
proof-of-support for an open-source project. Contributors who support the
project by building and maintaining it will earn that project's grain, and
backers who want to financially support the project can buy that grain, thus
funding the development of the project. Furthermore, projects will give 20% of
their grain to their dependencies, so that the whole open-source ecosystem will
be sustained, from exciting applications all the way down to core
infrastructure.

To make this vision a reality, we first need to build a system that can value
contributions to open-source projects and assign "cred" to them. The system
needs to be transparent, fair, and robust to gaming. It needs to value not only
new feature work and bugfixes, but also maintenance and refactoring. It needs
to value not only technical contributions like commits and pull requests, but
also non-technical contributions like community support and outreach. It needs
to sustain consensus within the community, reward collaboration, and value
long-term value. It needs to be able to distribute money without losing its
soul.

SourceCred is that system. It operates by discovering every contribution to a
project, organizing them into a network based on how they depend on each other,
and then gives every contribution a score based on the importance of the
contributions that are connected to it. It starts by finding contributions in
GitHub and Git, and enables communities to add more contributions that might
otherwise be missed. It is totally open-source, and invites configuration and
moderation by every community that uses it.

SourceCred is still in early stages; you can play with a prototype [here][prototype].
Our foundation is set, but there's still a lot of work to do! If you find this vision
inspiring, we'd love to have you involved. Please drop by our [Discord], say hello on our
[forums], or check out our [GitHub].

SourceCred is being created by [Protocol Labs]. The project is fully
open-source, and always will be. We're proud to be working alongside other
visionary groups focused on empowering open-source, including [Open Collective],
[GitCoin] and [Open Source Coin][OSCoin].
